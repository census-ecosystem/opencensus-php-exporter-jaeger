## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6
* 64-bit version of PHP

## Installation & basic usage

1. Install the `opencensus/opencensus-exporter-jaeger` package using [composer][composer]:

    ```bash
    $ composer require opencensus/opencensus-exporter-jaeger:~0.1
    ```

1. Initialize a tracer for your application:

    ```php
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Tracer;
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Exporter\JaegerExporter;

    Tracer::start(new JaegerExporter('my-service-name'));
    ```

## Customization

You may provide an associative array of options to the `JaegerExporter` at
initialization:

```php
$options = [];
$exporter = new JaegerExporter('my-service-name', $options);
```

The following options are available:

| Option | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `host` | "127.0.0.1" | The TCP IP address to send the UDP request to |
| `port` | 6931 | The TCP port to send the UDP request to |
| `tags` | (empty) | An associative array of tags to mark this process with |
| `client` | null | Optional [`AgentIf`][agent-interface] interface to use for testing |
